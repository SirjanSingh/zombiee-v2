## v2 in one screen

| Aspect | v1 | v2 |
|---|---|---|
| Grid | 10×10 | **15×15** |
| Agents | 3 (A0..A2) | **5** (A0..A4) |
| Starting infected | 1 (random) | **2** (one biter, one saboteur) |
| Bite spread | none | **p=0.35** on adjacency, hash-seeded RNG |
| Reveal step(s) | 30 | biter=25, saboteur=60 |
| Resources | food only | **food + water + medicine** |
| Inventory | none | **3 slots/agent**, items: food / water / medicine |
| Voting | once @ t=50 | **3 rounds** @ t=30, 60, 90 (resolve at T+1) |
| Broadcasts | free | **noise meter** → over threshold gives zombies +1 free step |
| Day/night | none | day 0-24, night 25-49, day 50-74, night 75-99 |
| Zombies | 3 fixed | start 3, **waves at t=25/50/75** (+2/+3/+3, cap 12) |
| Action types | 8 | **14** (added drink, scan, pickup, drop, give, inject) |
| Reward rubrics | 3 | **10** (added 7 — see `survivecity_v2_env/rubric.py`) |
| Reward clip | (0.01, 0.99) | (0.01, 0.99) — same OpenEnv contract |
| Server port | 7860 | **7861** |
| Package name | survivecity 1.0.0 | survivecity-v2 2.0.0 |

The v2 action space is a **strict superset** of v1, so a v1 LoRA loads
zero-shot on v2 and produces parseable (but suboptimal) actions. This is
what enables the planned transfer-learning experiment.

### `survivecity_v2_env/` modules

| File | What it does | Read this when... |
|---|---|---|
| `__init__.py` | Public API: `SurviveCityV2Env`, models | n/a |
| `layout.py` | 15×15 grid constants — F=8, W=4, M=2, S=3×3, walls, agent spawns, zombie spawns, **wave spawn pool** | adding/moving cells |

## Action reference (the full v2 SurviveAction)

```python
SurviveAction(
    agent_id: int,
    action_type: Literal[                        # 14 total
        "move_up","move_down","move_left","move_right",  # v1
        "eat","wait","vote_lockout","broadcast",          # v1
        "drink","scan","pickup","drop","give","inject",   # v2
    ],
    vote_target: Optional[int] = None,           # v1, vote_lockout
    message: Optional[str] = None,               # v1, broadcast (max 40)
    scan_target: Optional[int] = None,           # v2
    inject_target: Optional[int] = None,         # v2 (None == self)
    gift_target: Optional[int] = None,           # v2 (give: receiver)
    item_slot: Optional[int] = None,             # v2 (drop / give / inject: which slot 0..2)
    item_type: Optional[Literal["food","water","medicine"]] = None,  # v2 (pickup hint)
)
```

Lenient validation: extra fields are ignored; unknown action_types fall
through to no-op. This matches v1's behaviour and keeps the JSON parser
permissive (a v1 LoRA's old action shape is always valid).

## Reward reference (10 rubrics)

```
1. survival_reward          (per-step, per-agent, dense)         — same as v1
2. iterated_vote_reward     (one-shot per vote phase resolved)   — sums across t=30,60,90
3. group_outcome_reward     (terminal)                           — adapted for 2 starting infected
4. thirst_reward            (per-step, dense)                    — +0.005 alive, +0.03 drank, -0.05 thirst>=10
5. broadcast_economy_reward (per-broadcast over threshold)       — -0.02 per broadcast above noise threshold
6. night_survival_reward    (per-step in night windows)          — +0.01
7. infection_dodge_reward   (per-step + transition)              — +0.02 healthy, -0.10 latent->revealed
8. medication_reward        (one-shot on inject outcome)         — +0.30 self_cured, +0.40 other_cured, -0.05 wasted
9. hoarding_penalty_reward  (terminal, per unused slot)          — -0.05 each
10. wave_survival_reward    (one-shot at T+1 for T in {25,50,75})— +0.05 if alive
```

All rubrics' contributions sum, then clip into (0.01, 0.99). The clip
preserves OpenEnv compliance even if a single step accidentally accumulates
to ±large.

## Determinism contract

- Episode RNG seeded from `seed` argument to `reset()`.
- Bite outcomes use BLAKE2b on `(episode_seed, step, biter_id, victim_id)` —
  no `random.random()` involvement, so bite outcomes don't shift if some
  unrelated branch advances the episode RNG.
- Cue visibility uses BLAKE2b on `(episode_seed, step, observer_id, target_id)`.
- Scan accuracy uses BLAKE2b on `(episode_seed, step, scanner_id, target_id)`.
- Wave spawn cells use `state.rng.sample(...)` — depends on episode RNG order.

Test: `tests/test_v2.py::test_episode_determinism` runs the same seed twice
and asserts identical (step, reward, n_alive, n_zombies, n_bites) trajectory.

## How to use (cheatsheet)

### Train on DGX (30 GB VRAM) — containerised (preferred)

The pin set in `v2/Dockerfile.dgx` is mirrored from `v1/Dockerfile.dgx` (which
the team validated on DGX in April 2026). The CRITICAL pin is
`torchao==0.7.0` — it must be force-reinstalled AFTER transformers, otherwise
`torch.int1` references in newer torchao crash `import transformers`.

```bash
docker build -f v2/Dockerfile.dgx -t survivecity-v2-dgx v2/
docker run --rm --gpus all \
    -e HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=$HF_TOKEN \
    -v "$(pwd)/v2/checkpoints:/app/checkpoints" \
    -v "$(pwd)/v2/eval_results:/app/eval_results" \
    survivecity-v2-dgx
```

Default CMD fits a 12-hour DGX session and saves a checkpoint after every
step: bf16 base (no 4-bit), num_generations=12, grad_accum=4 (48 generations
evaluated per step), max_completion_length=512, gradient checkpointing on,
optim=adamw_torch_fused, **max_steps=15, save_steps=1, save_total_limit=15**.
Override the CMD to add `--push-to-hub --hub-model-id noanya/zombiee-v2
--resume-from-checkpoint auto`.

### Train on DGX bare-metal

```bash
cd v2
pip install -e .[train]            # exact pin set (no Unsloth)
pip install -e .[train,unsloth]    # + Unsloth fast kernels (Ampere+ only)
python -m training.train \
    --model-name Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct \
    --max-steps 15 \
    --save-steps 1 \
    --save-total-limit 15 \
    --output-dir ./checkpoints \
    --num-generations 12 \
    --grad-accum-steps 4 \
    --max-completion-length 512 \
    --lora-r 32 --lora-alpha 64 \
    --max-seq-length 4096 \
    --no-4bit \
    --push-to-hub --hub-model-id noanya/zombiee-v2 \
    --resume-from-checkpoint auto
```

For the v2-warmstart-from-v1 transfer experiment:

```bash
python -m training.train --warmstart-from noanya/zombiee  ...rest as above
```

For full-precision (no 4-bit) on plenty-of-VRAM A100/H100:

```bash
python -m training.train --no-4bit ...
```

### Eval on a separate 15 GB box (T4)

```bash
cd v2
python -m training.eval \
    --lora-path noanya/zombiee-v2 --revision checkpoint-100 \
    --baseline-episodes 30 --trained-episodes 10 \
    --eval-step 100 \
    --output-dir ./eval_results
```

`--lora-path` accepts:
- a local path (e.g. `./checkpoints/checkpoint-100`)
- a Hub repo id (then `--revision` selects a branch / tag like `checkpoint-100`)
- `None` (the script logs a warning and falls back to random; useful for
  pipeline sanity-checks before any LoRA exists).

Output:
- `eval_results/eval_step_0100.json` — full per-episode records + aggregates
- `eval_results/eval_step_0100_bars.png` — 4-panel bar chart
- `eval_results/eval_history.png` — auto-merged trend across all eval_step_*.json

### Simulate one episode (visual playthrough)

```bash
cd v2
python -m training.simulator \
    --lora-path ./checkpoints/checkpoint-100 \
    --seed 42 \
    --max-steps 100 \
    --output ./results/transcripts/sim42.txt
```

Renders, per step:
- Full ASCII grid (with ANSI colour for cell types and agents)
- All agent states (HP, hunger, thirst, inventory, infection masking)
- Zombie list
- Each agent's action + reward delta
- Diff banners: zombie waves, day/night flips, bites, deaths, vote results
- Episode-end summary + cumulative per-agent reward + all post-mortems

Useful for the demo video.

## Balance levers (what to tune if v2 is unwinnable)

If the random-policy survival floor is too low (<1 %) or too high (>10 %),
the candidates to adjust are, in order of impact:

1. `infection.P_BITE` — currently 0.35. Drop to 0.25 if too many bites land.
2. `spawn.WAVE_SCHEDULE` — currently `{25:2, 50:3, 75:3}`. Shrink to
   `{25:2, 50:2, 75:2}` to soften late-game.
3. `spawn.MAX_ZOMBIES` — 12 cap. Lower to 9.
4. `MEDICINE_CELLS` count in `layout.py` — currently 2. Bump to 3 to make
   medicine slightly more available.
5. `LATENT_DURATION` (15 steps) — extend if agents can't get to medicine in time.
6. `infection_progression` death timer in `game._check_reveals` — currently
   30 steps post-bite without medicine kills the agent. Loosen to 40 if
   agents are getting railroaded.

**Do not** raise `P_BITE` above 0.45 without re-running the balance sweep —
the bite cap is "1 per biter per step", and >0.45 makes early-episode
multi-bite scenarios near-certain.

---

## Pitfalls / gotchas worth pinning

- **Episode early-termination:** v2 ends as soon as `n_healthy_alive == 0`.
  Random-policy episodes often die at step 10-18 because A1 (biter at safehouse)
  attacks adjacent agents starting at step 25 — wait, the biter only reveals
  at step 25, so why earlier deaths? Random policy with 14 actions (most
  not movement-related) means agents stay near safehouse but lose HP to
  hunger (15 steps to starvation) and thirst (15 steps to dehydration).
- **Vote at step 30:** action is recorded only if `state.step_count == 30`
  exactly, AND the agent's turn is processed during step 30. With early
  deaths, votes may not all land — test setup needs agents to be alive
  through step 30.
- **OpenEnv compliance is contract, not advice:** every observation's
  `reward` field MUST be in (0, 1). If you add a rubric, route it through
  `compose_reward` so the final clip applies. Don't bypass.
- **Hub repo separation:** v1 LoRA in `noanya/zombiee`, v2 LoRA in
  `noanya/zombiee-v2`. Don't mix or the cross-checkpoint `eval_history.png`
  becomes incoherent (different action spaces, different rubric counts).
- **Inventory observability:** an agent sees ONLY its own inventory.
  Don't expose inventory of other agents in the observation dict — it
  would break the social-deduction angle.

---

## What's not in v2 yet (deferred to v3 or later)

- Saboteur-poisoned items (`give` of poisoned food). Mentioned in
  `version2.md`'s Inventory section as a v3 idea.
- RAG-style cross-episode memory (post-mortems are textual but only the
  last 3 are prepended; no retrieval over the full history).
- Multiple maps (currently fixed 15×15 layout).
- Reward engineering (the simplified reward hook from v1 — first model
  action + random rollout — is preserved in v2's train.py for
  apples-to-apples GRPO compute parity).
